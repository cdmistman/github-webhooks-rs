## Contributing

The only contributions I'll accept at the moment are those that update the schema.
For other contributions, please open an issue first.

The repository is set up using a [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) shell for easy startup.
It also has a [direnv](https://direnv.net/) configuration, so you can just run `direnv allow` to get started.
It's possible to contribute using a non-Nix environment, but you'll have to figure out how to download the schema yourself.

To update the schema, first run `download-schema` (script defined within the nix development shell) then run `cargo build`.
After this, you should delete `schema.json` to prevent the build script from running again, then `cargo fmt` to format the generated code.
Finally, open a PR with the changes.
